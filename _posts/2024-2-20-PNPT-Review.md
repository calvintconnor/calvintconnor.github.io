This post has three headings depending on what information you need. 

1. My Journey is a recount of everything I have done in life and up to to prepare for the OSCP.
2. The Down Low is everything you want to know about the exam: how it feels, what you need to be prepared, and what to expect.
3. Now What? is my exanding on the OSCP and where and what it fails to teach you.
