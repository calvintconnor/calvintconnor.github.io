To whom it may concern,
What makes a great cybersecurity professional? Some may say it is certifications, experience,
or education, but you and I know it as the naturally inquisitive want to understand something new.
Where others are satisfied with results without understanding, you can rely on me to pursue every
topic to its deepest subject. While I do possess the certifications, experience, and education that
others expect, I am also unafraid to put my whole life into my work. When you hire me, you do not just
get my knowledge, you get the enthusiastic, meticulous, rigorous methodology that has driven me this
far.
In my free time have studied and passed both the OSCP (Offensive Security Certified
Professional) and PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester) ethical hacking certifications while
working as a network administrator. I regularly complete the latest HTB boxes, configure my own
home lab, and write about security topics on my blog. I have a desire and passion to learn, a need for
achievement, and a hunger to do whatever I do to the absolute best of its capacity. Furthermore, I
know beyond any doubt my quality of work will far surpass anyone else, and I have proven countless
times in my previous positions that I can push quality beyond the highest of standards.


Thank You,

Calvin T. Connor
