## Bio
Running a marathon and hacking my first box solicitated the same challenge inside myself: do whatever I do to the best of my ability. It does not matter if its your first engagement or your thousandth, you approach every one as if it is going to be your best one so far. This mentality has driven me to become a bodybuilder, hacker, and cybersecurity consultant while pursuing excellence in each respective field. As C.S. Lewis once said, “You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream”.
